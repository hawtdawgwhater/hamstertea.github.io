					What I Changed
					</h1>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
					I used the frozen yogurt shop template from freewebsitetemplates. The files I got rid of are mobile.css, mobile.js, singlepost, contact, and blog. I also deleted all the provided fonts and imported some from google fonts. 
					I edited the products.html adding in all my teas with thier images and renamed the file to drinks.html. I made a copy of drinks.html and renamed it to toppings.html. On the home page I kept the general layout editing the 
					navigation bar to reflect my boba shop and changed all images with exception of one icon that I left. About.hmtl has the whole body removed and replaced with a paragraph about my boba shop. All pages have the included footer 
					with social media links removed and replaced with my footer that includes my name and student ID. In the css file I removed all unnecessary code for the html files that I deleted. I have changed the color of the header, body,
					and footer on every page. All text have had thier color changed including the font style. The js file I made is suppsoed to be a human verification to prevent hamsters from accessing our website.
